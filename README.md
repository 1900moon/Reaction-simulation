# Reaction-simulation
Using MC method to simulate 6He(d,n)7Li reaction, get the reaction yield Yield for 0-180 angles in the c.m. system.  
# Usage
First, you shoud do as follows:  
1.mkdir build  
2.cd build   
3.cmake ..  
4.make -jN  
Second, you will obtain a executable program named a.out, and then ./a.out, you can start your simulation 
# elastic scattering simulation  
if you want to simulate elastic scattering reaction, you can refer Okawa's method: https://github.com/kodaiokawa/sim_6he_practice
