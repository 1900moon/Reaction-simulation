# Reaction-simulation
Using MC method to simulate nuclear reaction
First, you shoud do as follows:
1.mkdir build
2.cd build 
3.cmake ..
4.make -jN
Second, you will obtain a executable program named a.out, and then ./a.out, you can start your simulation
if you want to simulate elastic scattering reaction, you can refer Okawa's method:
