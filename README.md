# Reaction-simulation
Using MC method to simulate 6He(d,n)7Li reaction, estimating the reaction yield for 1-180 angles in the c.m. system. 
And this code based on Okawa's method of elastic scattering, https://github.com/kodaiokawa/sim_6he_practice
# Usage
You shoud do 5 steps as follows:  
1. mkdir build  
2. cd build   
3. cmake ..  
4. make -jN  
5. a.out  
You can start your simulation now!
